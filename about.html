<p  style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height:30px; margin-bottom:50px;"> Bears, a small group of mostly large omnivorous mammals, can be found all over the world; they live in forests, mountains, tundra, deserts and grassy areas. Though there are different types of bear, all bear species have similarities. They all have stocky, fur-covered bodies; short legs; and a round head with a long snout.
There are eight species of bear: American black bear, Asiatic black bear, brown bear, giant panda bear, polar bear, spectacled bear, sloth bear and sun bear, according to the International Association for Bear Research & Management.

<h1 style="font-size:50px; text-align:center;"> About Tiger </h1>

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height:30px; margin-bottom:50px;">The tiger is a powerful icon of India’s cultural and natural heritage, and its survival has been a top priority for WWF-India since it was founded.
In the early 1970s, WWF India began its efforts to save the tiger with the vital support it provided towards Project Tiger – the first-ever Tiger Conservation Programme launched by the Government of India in 1973. 
In the early 1990s, WWF India initiated a focused Tiger Conservation Programme.
 Since then, we have been working with the Project Tiger, National Tiger Conservation Authority, state forest departments, local communities and other stakeholders to address critical conservation issues in different tiger landscapes.
